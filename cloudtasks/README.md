# C# Google Cloud Tasks sample for Google App Engine

This sample application shows how to use [Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-tasks/)
on Google App Engine [flexible environment][appengine].

App Engine queues push tasks to an App Engine HTTP target. This directory
contains both the App Engine app to deploy, as well as the snippets to run
locally to push tasks to it, which could also be called on App Engine.

The `TasksSample` project contains a simple command-line program that creates
tasks to be pushed to the App Engine app.

`CloudTasks` is the main App Engine app. This app serves as an endpoint to
receive App Engine task attempts.

`app.yaml` configures the app for the App Engine C# flexible
environment.

## Setup

Before you can run or deploy the sample, you need to do the following:

1.  Refer to the [appengine/README.md][readme] file for instructions on
    running and deploying.
1.  Enable the Cloud Tasks API in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/tasks.googleapis.com).
1.  Set up [Google Application Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
1.  Install dependencies:

        dotnet restore

## Creating a queue

To create a queue using the Cloud SDK, use the following gcloud command:

    gcloud beta tasks queues create-app-engine-queue my-queue

Note: A newly created queue will route to the default App Engine service and
version unless configured to do otherwise.

## Deploying the app to App Engine flexible environment

Move into the App Engine folder:

  cd appengine

Deploy the App Engine app with `gcloud`:

    ```psm1
    PS > dotnet restore
    PS > dotnet publish
    PS > gcloud beta app deploy .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\publish\app.yaml
    ```

Verify the index page is serving:

    gcloud app browse

## Run the Sample Using the Command Line

Set environment variables:

First, your project ID:

    export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=my-project-id

Then the queue ID, as specified at queue creation time. Queue IDs already
created can be listed with `gcloud beta tasks queues list`.

    export GCP_QUEUE=my-queue

And finally the location ID, which can be discovered with
`gcloud beta tasks queues describe $GCP_QUEUE`, with the location embedded in
the "name" value (for instance, if the name is
"projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/queues/my-queue", then the
location is "us-central1").

    export LOCATION_ID=us-central1

Move into the Tasks Sample folder:

    cd ../api/TasksSample

Run the tests:

    dotnet test
